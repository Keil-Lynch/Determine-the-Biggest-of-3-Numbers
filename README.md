Determine the Biggest of 3 Numbers

Description

The program finds the largest number among the three.

Problem Solution

1. Input the three numbers.
2. Compare the first number with the other two.
3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for two more numbers.
4. Print the highest number among all.  
5. Proceed to exit.

Program Explanation

1. Assign the three numbers to the variables num1, num2, and num3.
2. Ensure that num1 is greater than num2.
3. It should be greater than num3, if it is.
4. If this is the case, then print the output as "num1 is the greatest among three".
5. If otherwise, print "num3 is the greatest".
6. Number 1 must be greater than number 2, then number 2 must be greater than number 3.
7. The output should be "num2 is the greatest among three".
8. Alternatively, print "num3 is the greatest of three" if 3 is the greatest number of all three.

Test Case Study (Run Program)

After running the program;

(Console prompt): Enter the values of num1, num2 and num3

User input: 287 893 10

Output: num1 = 278        num2 = 893            num3 = 10
num2 is the greatest among three
